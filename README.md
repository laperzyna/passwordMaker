# Password Generator
    This program is a password generator program. When the user clicks the generate button they are prompted with a question
    asking what length they would like their password to be. Once selected, the user will be asked if they would like their
     password to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The program takes the users 
     choices and generates a password according to those choices.

# What I struggled with
    I love Java. It's my bread and butter so working with Javascript has been super fun for me. I have been struggling with 
    error handling lately. I'm not sure why and I've been playing around with it but just can never seem to get it to work.
    I feel like I may just be using the wrong syntax because I feel like my logic is right but I could be wrong about the logic too.
    Regardless, I had a lot of fun with this assignment.
